          <h2>Massage Therapy</h2>
        <p>Circulation is often impaired in diabetics due to the damaging effects of elevated blood sugar levels on the cells of the body.
           Massage of the hands and feet can be particularly beneficial. Our massage therapists can help increase the circulation of blood and lymph,
           to facilitate the transport of oxygen and other nutrients into the body's tissues, including more efficiency in the uptake of insulin by cells.</p>
